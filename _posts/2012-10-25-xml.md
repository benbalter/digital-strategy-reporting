          <value>The Department of Defense (DoD) engages customers using a variety of methods. DoD interfaces with service providers and customers to help identify which services are the most popular and possible high priority candidates for API conversion. The DoD datasets on data.gov provide further insight on what information customers are currently accessing for possible API conversion. The DoD Open Government page at http://open.dodlive.mil/ has been updated to allow external customers to provide input as to which datasets should be available through a Web API. Customer feedback will be included with resource availability and budget constraints to prioritize the services made available via Web APIs.</value>
